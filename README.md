# AO3 Stat Tracker
A tool for tracking the statistics of your works on the fanfiction site Archive of Our Own.

On AO3, you can see your cumulative stats but you can't see your stats over time. This program is designed so that every time you run it, it pulls all your stats and adds them to a cummulative file.
